## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

&nbsp;  
### What I learned

Another easy enough project. I plan to start using React soon as I am feeling much more confident putting my HTML, CSS and JS together in these challenges. I have been learning React syntax for a while now, I just need to start implementing it into real projects.
